The easiest way is the automatic method, which you start with one click. <strong>WARNING:</strong> The automatic registration may not work under certain circumstances. In particular, it is even impossible if outdated browsers such as Internet Explorer or Edge are used. In this case, a TS-ID can be entered manually.</p> <p> However, the automatic method should be prioritised so that no further manual assignments are necessary. This would have to be done by the staff and until this happens you would not have the full service available.</p>
